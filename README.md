# To-Do-List_Python

This is a simple interactive to-do list application built entirely in Python for use in the command line (or terminal). It allows users to manage their tasks by adding new items, viewing existing ones, marking tasks as complete, and deleting them.

This project is an excellent exercise for beginners to understand core Python concepts like lists, loops, conditional statements, and user input/output in a practical application.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add Task:** Easily add new to-do items to your list.
* **View Tasks:** Display all current tasks with their corresponding numbers.
* **Mark Task as Complete:** Mark a task as done by its number (adds "(DONE)" to the task description).
* **Delete Task:** Remove a task from the list using its number.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple numbered menu for easy navigation.
* **Persistent Session (in-memory):** Tasks are stored as long as the application is running (they are cleared when the program exits).

## üöÄ How to Use

To run this To-Do List application, you'll need Python installed on your computer.

### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you have a recent version of Python 3 installed.)

### Running the Application

1.  **Save the code:**
    * Save the Python code for the To-Do List (from our previous conversation) into a file named `todo_list.py`.
    * Place this file in a convenient folder on your computer (e.g., `Documents/PythonProjects/todo-app`).

2.  **Open your Command Prompt / Terminal:**
    * **On Windows:** Navigate to the folder where you saved `todo_list.py` in File Explorer. Click on the address bar at the top, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.
    * **On Mac/Linux:** Open your Terminal application. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your `todo_list.py` file is located. For example: `cd ~/Documents/PythonProjects/todo-app`.

3.  **Execute the Python script:**
    * Once you are in the correct directory in your Command Prompt/Terminal, type the following command and press `Enter`:
        ```bash
        python todo_list.py
        ```

4.  **Interact with the To-Do List:**
    * The application will start, display a menu, and prompt you for a choice.
    * Type the number corresponding to the action you want to perform (e.g., `1` to add a task, `2` to view tasks).
    * Follow the on-screen instructions.
    * To exit the application, type `5` and press `Enter`.

## üß† Concepts Demonstrated

* `list` data structure for task storage.
* `while` loops for continuous program execution.
* `if`/`elif`/`else` for menu navigation and conditional logic.
* `input()` for user interaction.
* `print()` for displaying information.
* Basic error handling (`try-except` for number input, `if` statements for valid choices/numbers).
* Functions (`def`) for organizing code into reusable blocks.
